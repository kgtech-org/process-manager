# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current Repository State

This repository currently contains only documentation resources related to incident management procedures for Togocom telecommunications services. The main content is a French-language PDF document (`resources/example/PROCEDURES DE GESTION DES INCIDENTS PDF.pdf`) that outlines:

- Incident detection and classification procedures
- Network Operations Center (NOC) escalation processes  
- Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements
- Priority levels (P1-P4) for incident severity
- Contact lists and notification procedures

## Future Development

When code is added to this repository, common commands and architecture details should be documented here. The incident management procedures in the PDF suggest this may evolve into a process management or incident response system.

## Domain Context

This project appears to be related to telecommunications network incident management, specifically for Togocom's infrastructure including:
- Network surveillance and monitoring
- Service restoration procedures
- Performance metrics tracking
- Multi-level escalation workflows
