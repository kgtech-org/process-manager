# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Process Manager application for telecommunications companies, designed to digitize and manage procedural documentation. The system allows collaborative creation of processes through multi-step forms, with features for digital signatures, PDF export, and monthly performance validation through incident reports.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Go/Gin with MongoDB, Redis, JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: MinIO for object storage
- **Infrastructure**: Full Docker containerization

## Contributing Workflow

All development follows a GitHub issue-based workflow with MCP integration:

### ðŸ¤– Claude Code MCP Integration Rules

When working on this project, always follow these rules:

1. **Use MCP GitHub Tools**: Always use MCP GitHub tools for issue and branch management
2. **Issue-to-Branch Workflow**: Create branches from GitHub issues using MCP tools, never with local git commands
3. **Automated Operations**: Let Claude Code handle GitHub operations like creating PRs, managing issues, and branch operations
4. **Proper Linking**: Maintain GitHub's native issue-to-branch linking through MCP tools

### Workflow Steps

1. **Issue Creation**: All features, bugs, and improvements start with a GitHub issue
2. **Branch Creation**: Create work branches from GitHub issues using MCP tools:
   - Use GitHub's "Create a branch" feature from the issue
   - GitHub automatically creates branches with format: `{issue-number}-{issue-title-slug}`
   - Fetch and checkout the branch locally: `git fetch origin && git checkout {branch-name}`

3. **Development**: Work on the feature/fix in your branch
4. **Pull Request**: Use MCP tools to create PRs that reference the issue
5. **Review & Merge**: PR gets reviewed and merged after approval

### Branch Examples (Auto-generated by GitHub)

8-update-api-documentation
42-improve-ui-components
```

### Important Reminders for Claude Code
- **NEVER** create branches manually with `git checkout -b`
- **ALWAYS** use MCP GitHub tools for GitHub operations
- **ALWAYS** create branches from issues to maintain proper tracking
- **PREFER** MCP operations over manual GitHub web interface
